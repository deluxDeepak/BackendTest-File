Kya Schema banan jaruri hai ?Agr data pehle se hi hai to 

Yes, in Mongoose (for MongoDB), you still need to define a Schema and Model, even if the data already exists in the database.

The schema doesn't create new data — it tells Mongoose how to read and work with existing documents in collections.
