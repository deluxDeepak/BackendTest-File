ICE servers play a crucial role in establishing connectivity between peers located behind different networks. STUN servers help peers discover their public IP addresses and the type of NAT they're behind, while TURN servers act as relay points when direct peer-to-peer connection isn't possible. In production environments, it's recommended to configure multiple ICE servers from different providers to ensure maximum connectivity success rates.

Close A peer Connection
Once you don't need to maintain the peer connection anymore, you can close the WebRTC call with RTCPeerConnection.close() method. This method terminates the entire active streams and ongoing ICE processing and releases all connectivities and resources the connection uses.

-> Properly closing a peer connection is essential for resource management and preventing memory leaks in WebRTC applications. The close() method performs a comprehensive cleanup process that goes beyond simply stopping media streams. It closes all associated RTCDataChannels, stops all RTCRtpSenders and RTCRtpReceivers, terminates ICE gathering and checking processes, and releases all network resources including TURN allocations if they were being used.

->It's important to note that once a peer connection is closed, it cannot be reopened or reused. The connection transitions to a "closed" state permanently, and any attempts to perform operations on it will result in exceptions. For applications that need to reestablish connections, a new RTCPeerConnection instance must be created. Additionally, closing a peer connection doesn't automatically stop the media streams that were added to it; those need to be stopped separately if they're no longer needed, preventing continued access to user media devices like cameras and microphones.
